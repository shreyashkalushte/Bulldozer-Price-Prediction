# Bulldozer Price Prediction

In this project, we'll use a [Bulldozer Price dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/bluebook-for-bulldozers/) taken from Kaggle, to create a regression machine learning model that will predict the auction price of a bulldozer, given different factors, such as different machine configurations and year of manufacturing.

Activate the environment, with:

```bash
conda activate ./env
```
